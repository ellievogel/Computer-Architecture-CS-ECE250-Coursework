## Problem 1: Tribonacci

**File:** `tribonacci.c`

**Description:**
This program prints the first N Tribonacci numbers, where N is provided as a command line argument.

## Problem 2: Recursion

**File:** `recurse.c`

**Description:**
This recursive program calculates the function f(N), where N is a positive integer provided as a command line argument. The function is defined as:
- f(0) = 2
- f(N) = 3*N â€“ 2*f(N-1) + 7 (for N > 0)

## Problem 3: Plus/Minus Ranking

**File:** `plusminus.c`

**Description:**
This program reads a file containing basketball player statistics and computes the "plus/minus" metric for each player. The input file format is as follows:
- Each player's statistics are contained in 4 lines:
  1. Player's last name
  2. Points scored by the player's team while on the court (an integer)
  3. Points scored by the opposing team while the player is on the court (an integer)
  4. A blank line or separator (not included in the count)

- The file ends with the string `DONE`.

The program calculates the plus/minus metric for each player using the formula:
- Plus/Minus = (Points scored by the player's team) - (Points scored by the opposing team)

The output will list each player's name along with their plus/minus value. The list is sorted in descending order based on the plus/minus metric. In case of a tie, players are sorted alphabetically by their last name.
